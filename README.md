## Password Generator

## Description

Refactored code to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
